introduce you to the basics of Next.js.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that allows you to build server-rendered React applications with ease. It provides a number
of features out of the box, such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes, that make it easy to
build fast and scalable React applications.

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

## Why use Next.js?

Next.js is a great choice for building server-rendered React applications because it provides a number of features that
make it easy to build fast and scalable applications. Some of the key features of Next.js include:

- Server-side rendering: Next.js allows you to render your React components on the server, which can improve performance
and SEO.
- Static site generation: Next.js can generate static HTML files for your pages at build time, which can improve
performance and reduce hosting costs.
- API routes: Next.js allows you to create API routes that can be used to fetch data from external APIs or perform
server-side logic.

## How to use Next.js

To use Next.js, you need to create a new Next.js project by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

This will create a new Next.js project in a directory called `my-app`. You can then navigate to the project directory
and start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your Next.js application in your browser. You can then start building
your application by creating new pages, components, and API routes.
